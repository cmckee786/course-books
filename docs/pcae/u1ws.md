#### Discussion Post #1

The first question of this course is, "What is automation?"

1. If you've done the previous courses, how would you define administration? If you
   haven't find a blog (link for us) and explain how they define administration of Linux
   systems.

2. If you've done the previous course, how would you define security? If you haven't
   find a blog (link for us) and explain how they define administration of Linux systems.

3. When you think about automation, how does it tie into things you do on a daily
   basis, inside or outside of computer systems?

#### Discussion Post #2

What is meant by a trigger in automation?

1. What is your definition of a trigger?

2. What are the types of triggers you read or can define?

3. Where would you place these triggers to positively affect your ability to
   build or administer Linux systems?

## Digging Deeper

1. Go to serverless land: <https://serverlessland.com/patterns>

    1. Can you implement one of the serverless architectures in the cloud via one
      of the automation tools we have talked about?

    2. Do you see any other automation tools you may use in your career?

2. While we will be going over many concepts in this course, reviewing
   <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs> and ensuring
   you have a strong understanding of Ansible will help absorb this information.

## Reflection Questions
