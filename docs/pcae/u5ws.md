#### Discussion Post #1

You know about variable precedence and have decided to study it for your Ansible playbooks.
Read <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html> 
and answer the following questions:

1. What is variable precedence and why should it matter?

2. What does it mean to register a variable, and how is that variable used in the playbook?

3. How might variables be useful at the end of an automation, in relation to reporting out 
   what happened in the playbook?


#### Discussion Post #2

You've stumbled on a playbook and you're trying to figure out what the following line means:
<img src="../../assets/pcae/images/u5/u5_dp2_playbook.png"/>

You have reviewed Jinja2 filters
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_filters.html#providingdefault-values>
and think you have a good handle on what is happening.

1. What is the variable name being called?

2. What is the default value if that variable does not exist or is not populated?

3. What is the reason this might be nice in your executions if you want them always to
   complete?

4. Is there a danger to always setting default values?
    1. Or another way to ask that, is there a tradeoff between always finishing and
       sometimes having incorrectly set values?
    2. Where will you use these in your automations?
